    At first, we submitted our paper to arxiv, but arxiv stated that they do not accept commentary papers, so we decided to submit to JHEP. However, JHEP turned out to be quite an odd journal.
</p>
<p>
    First, it is an open-access journal but does not require any payment. It is a journal under Scoap3, and its publication fees come from donated funds (which means they always profit as long as papers are published).
</p>
<p>
    Second, JHEP has a tied relationship with arxiv. If a paper has not been submitted to arxiv, it cannot be submitted to JHEP (submission to JHEP requires a arxiv ID).
</p>
<p>
    Third, after submitting to JHEP, the paper entered the review process. Interestingly, after more than two months of review, we received the following feedback:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>"Please note that JCAP is not a journal for comments. The paper has
    to contain at least a new result. Moreover, concerning topic it should be
    submitted to more suitable journal specialised cosmology.
    </p><p>
    Please also be aware that using the arXiv ID number of someone else’s
    paper to submit your contribution is regarded as misconduct and is against
    JHEP’s ethical policy"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    What’s even more peculiar is that the editors not only refuse to handle problematic papers but also do not accept or process them. They only care about new results, not the correctness of those results. Isn’t this just the same style as arxiv?
</p>
<p>
    At that point, we realized the root of the problem: we shouldn’t have sent such harsh emails to criticize the arxiv team (they ended up banning our account).

      <p>
          This paper reviews the “ Principle Study of Gravitational Pressure and Thermodynamics of FRW Universe (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/JHEP12%282022%29168" target="_blank">J. High Energ.

Importantly, their definition of pressure is completely incorrect in both method and results.
      </p>

      <h2>Comments</h2>
      <p>
          Recently, we authored a paper titled "Paper Mills and Research Integrity in Cosmology: Investigating P-V Phase Transitions in Massive" <sup>[1]</sup>. In that paper, we discussed unethical practices in cosmological thermodynamics research. The current paper is a continuation and elaboration of that work.
      </p>
  
      <p>
          As discussed in <sup>[1]</sup>, there are serious issues in cosmological thermodynamics research, including fraud, duplicate publication, and plagiarism. The paper we are reviewing, <i>First Principle Study of Gravitational Pressure and Thermodynamics of FRW Universe</i> <sup>[2]</sup>, contains the same content as another work, <i>Thermodynamics of FRW Universe: Heat Engine</i><sup>[3]</sup>. This is an act of plagiarism, and we urge the scientific community to take this issue seriously.
      </p>

      <p>
        Both papers calculated the entropy, Joule-Thomson coefficient, inversion temperature, and inversion pressure for the FLRW universe. Reference <sup>[3]</sup> could have incorporated pressure into its calculation results, but did not; instead, it extended the analysis by including the calculation of thermal efficiency, which was not done in Reference <sup>[2]</sup>. The content and logical framework of Reference <sup>[2]</sup> are identical to those of Reference <sup>[3]</sup>, with the exception that it incorporates pressure and analyzes phase transitions. The biggest problem is just how they calculate and define this pressure. Their calculations severely violate mathematical principles, and the pressure they define is the opposite of what it should be in reality.
    </p>

    <p>
        The research subject, methodology, and logical framework of these two papers have been discussed in detail in Reference <sup>[1]</sup>, so we will not revisit them here.
    </p>

    <p>First, let’s examine their calculation results for the apparent horizon, temperature, and volume.</p>

     <p>
          In Reference <sup>[3]</sup>, the results are as follows:
      </p>
  
      <p><strong>Apparent horizon:</strong></p>
      <div class="math-block">
          $$ r_h = \frac{1}{\sqrt{H^2 + \frac{k}{a^2}}} $$
      </div>
  
      <p><strong>Temperature:</strong></p>
      <div class="math-block">
          $$ T = \frac{1}{2\pi r_h}\left(1 - \frac{\dot{r_h}}{2r_h H}\right) $$
      </div>
  
      <p><strong>Volume:</strong></p>
      <div class="math-block">
          $$ V_h = \frac{4}{3} \pi r_h^3 $$
      </div>
  
      <p>These physical quantities are calculated in the same way in Reference <sup>[2]</sup>.</p>

        <p><strong>Apparent horizon:</strong></p>
        <div class="math-block">
            $$ r_h = \frac{1}{\sqrt{H^2 + \frac{k}{a^2}}} $$
        </div>
    
        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong></p>
        <div class="math-block">
            $$ T = \frac{1}{2\pi r_h}\left(1 - \frac{\dot{r_h}}{2r_h H}\right) $$
        </div>
    
        <p><strong>Volume:</strong></p>
        <div class="math-block">
            $$ V_h = \frac{4}{3} \pi r_h^3 $$
        </div>
    
        <p>In Reference <sup>[3]</sup>, the entropy is calculated using the following equation:</p>
        <div class="math-block">
            $$ dQ = 4\pi r_h^2 (\rho + p) H r_h dt = T dS $$
        </div>
    
        <p>Here, $\rho$ and $p$ are the energy density and pressure of the FLRW universe, respectively, and they satisfy the equation:</p>
        <div class="math-block">
            $$ T_{\mu\nu} = (\rho + p) u_{\mu} u_{\nu} + p g_{\mu\nu} $$
        </div>
    
        <p>The resulting entropy is:</p>
        <div class="math-block">
            $$ S = \pi r_h^2 $$
        </div>


          <p>In Reference <sup>[2]</sup>, it’s unclear how the entropy was derived, but it still equals:</p>
          <div class="math-block">
              $$ S = \pi r_h^2 $$
          </div>
      
          <p>The energy in Reference <sup>[2]</sup> is given by:</p>
          <div class="math-block">
              $$ E = \frac{R}{2}\left[-\frac{\Lambda}{3} R^2 + R^2 \left(H^2 + \frac{k}{a^2}\right)\right] $$
          </div>
      
          <p>The authors were already aware of four out of the five physical quantities: $E$, $T$, $S$, and $V$. So they actually can <strong style="color: red;">use the first law of thermodynamics,</strong></p>
          <div class="math-block">
              $$ dE = T dS - P dV $$
          </div>
          <p>to calculate the pressure. Instead, they chose to adopt the first law of thermodynamics due to its similarity to the unified first law:</p>
          <div class="math-block">
              $$ dE = T dS + w dV $$
          </div>
          <p>where $w$ is the work density. That is why? That is because the authors plagiarized Reference <sup>[3]</sup> and followed their approach.</p>

            <p>Reference <sup>[3]</sup> derived the Friedmann equations:</p>
        
            <div class="math-block">
                $$ H^2 + \frac{k}{a^2} = \frac{8\pi}{3} \rho + \frac{\Lambda}{3} $$
            </div>
        
            <div class="math-block">
                $$ \dot{H} - \frac{k}{a^2} = -4\pi (\rho + p) $$
            </div>
        
            <div class="math-block">
                $$ \dot{\rho} + 3H(\rho + p) = 0 $$
            </div>
        
            <p>and obtained the expressions for the energy density $\rho$ and pressure $p$:</p>
        
            <div class="math-block">
                $$ \rho = \frac{3}{8\pi r_h^2} - \frac{\Lambda}{8\pi} $$
            </div>
        
            <div class="math-block">
                $$ p = -\frac{1}{8\pi r_h^2} + \frac{\Lambda}{8\pi} $$
            </div>
        
            <p>Reference <sup>[2]</sup> also derived the energy density $\rho$ and pressure $p$ from the Friedmann equations:</p>
        
            <div class="math-block">
                $$ \rho = \frac{3}{8\pi r_h^2} - \frac{\Lambda}{8\pi} $$
            </div>
        
            <div class="math-block">
                $$ p = -\frac{3}{8\pi r_h^2} + \frac{\Lambda}{8\pi} + \frac{\dot{r}_h}{4\pi H r_h^3} = -\frac{1}{8\pi r_h^2} + \frac{\Lambda}{8\pi} $$
            </div>
        
            <p>So, this calculation is exactly the same.</p>

              <p>Both papers calculate the Joule-Thomson coefficient using the following equation:</p>
              <div class="math-block">
                  $$ \mu = \frac{1}{C P} \left[T \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right) P - V \right] $$
              </div>
          
              <p>Therefore, the results should be identical since the physical quantities in the equation are the same. Additionally, the methods and formulas used to calculate the inversion temperature and inversion pressure are exactly the same.</p>
          
              <p><strong style="color: red;">From the above content, it is evident that all the content in Reference <sup>[2]</sup> is identical to that in Reference <sup>[3]</sup>, which constitutes plagiarism.</strong></p>

                    I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention a concern that has arisen during the review of a recent paper. Our team has identified significant overlaps between your paper, "First Principle Study of Gravitational Pressure and Thermodynamics of FRW Universe," and an earlier publication, "Thermodynamics of FRW Universe: Heat Engine."
                    The analysis indicates that both papers share identical content, including calculations and logical frameworks, particularly concerning the apparent horizon, temperature, volume, entropy, and the derived Friedmann equations. This resemblance extends to methodologies used for calculating physical quantities such as the Joule-Thomson coefficient and inversion temperature. This overlap raises concerns about potential plagiarism or duplicate publication.

                      I wanted to clarify that the paper titled "First Principle Study of Gravitational Pressure and Thermodynamics of FRW Universe" is a revised version of "Thermodynamics of FRW Universe: Heat Engine."

                          You maybe have made a misunderstanding about the paper "Thermodynamics of FRW Universe: Heat Engine" which is written by Ujjal Debnath and published in Phys.Lett.B 810(2020) 135807. Therefore, of course, our paper "First Principle Study of Gravitational Pressure and Thermodynamics of FRW Universe" could not be the revised version of the paper "Thermodynamics of FRW Universe: Heat Engine".

In fact, if one is an expert on gravity and cosmology, one will easily find that in our paper we not only first proposed a more suitable thermodynamic pressure $P = -W$ from the first principle study of the unified first law instead of $P$ simply related to the cosmological constant, but also first obtained the thermodynamic equation of state for a FRW universe, while the later paper has not at all attached these issues.

                        <p>
                            Professor Ya-Peng Hu seems to suggest that their papers have some novelty, specifically in redefining pressure and calculating the state equations. In reality, the main issue with their paper is the definition of pressure. Let's take a look at how they define it.

                            As mentioned earlier, Reference <sup>[2]</sup> calculated the pressure using the equations:

                                Curiously, the differential of the cosmological constant is not equal to zero: $ \frac{r_h^3}{6} d{\Lambda}$ ≠ 0 , although it should be. Why did they do this? This seems like a deliberate attempt to add something meaningless by redefining the pressure.
                            </p>
                        
                            <p>
                                Their goal appears to be because:
                            </p>
                        
                            <div class="math-block">

                            <p>
                                If $ \frac{r_h^3}{6} d{\Lambda} = 0   $, the definition of pressure would be the same as in previous studies. By adding this term, they define the pressure as:
                            </p>
                        
                            <div class="math-block">
                                $$ P = w + \frac{\Lambda}{8\pi} = \frac{T}{2R_{A}} + \frac{1}{8 \pi R_{A}^2} $$

                            <p>
                                Additionally, there are issues with the calculation of $ w + \frac{\Lambda}{8\pi} $.
                                In fact, it should be:
                            </p>
                        
                            <div class="math-block">
                                $$ P = w + \frac{\Lambda}{8\pi} = \frac{T}{R_{A}} + \frac{1}{8 \pi R_{A}^2} $$

                            <p>
                                If the differential of the cosmological constant is not zero, the pressure equals:
                            </p>

                            </div>

                              <p>
                                  This correct pressure is just equal to the work density $ w = \frac{1}{2}(\rho + p) $, which is the same as in Reference <sup>[3]</sup>, since $ \rho $ and $ p $ are identical in both papers.
                              </p>

                                  Now, we can clearly see that the reason for making the differential of the cosmological constant non-zero is precisely this. To create this “novelty”, they added the term $ -V \frac{\Lambda}{8\pi} $ to the energy, which introduced the extra term $ \frac{\Lambda}{8\pi} $ in the pressure. It's similar to adding the same thing to both sides of an equation to keep it valid—the only difference is that the energy and pressure now have an additional constant value.
                              </p>

                                    Looking at it this way, the most "innovative" aspect of the paper is simply making the differential of the cosmological constant non-zero. The major issue in this study lies in removing the term associated with the cosmological constant from the pressure. In the late universe, pressure can be split into two components: $ P_{rad} = \frac{T}{R_{A}} + \frac{1}{8 \pi R_{A}^2} $ and $ -\frac{\Lambda}{8\pi} $, where $ -\frac{\Lambda}{8\pi} \gg \frac{T}{R_{A}} + \frac{1}{8 \pi R_{A}^2} $.
                                    The term $ -\frac{\Lambda}{8\pi} $ represents the contribution of dark energy and is responsible for the expansion of the universe. By "redefining" it away, are they suggesting the universe can still be an expanding one without it? This directly contradicts our understanding of reality.

                                <p>Lastly, the title of the paper, <i>First Principle Study of Gravitational Pressure and Thermodynamics of FRW Universe</i>, is misleading. As mentioned earlier, this is not a first principle study. The research methodology and content have already been reported by others, making the title inappropriate.</p>
