        <h1>Paper Mills and Research Integrity in Cosmology: Investigating P-V Phase Transitions in Massive Gravitational Systems</h1>
        <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong><br>We will use a discussion of some recently encountered papers to explain the phenomenon of "paper mills" in the context of cosmological thermodynamics. We explored how these operations produce papers, discussed their harmful effects, and examined the internal and external factors contributing to this issue. Additionally, we expressed our hopes for the healthy development of research in this field.</p>

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>A hundred years ago, the birth of general relativity allowed us to study the laws of nature on a higher dimension. Fifty years ago, the concepts of black hole entropy and temperature were proposed by Jacob Bekenstein and Stephen Hawking, respectively. This marked the fusion of general relativity with thermodynamics.</p>
        <p>...</p>
        
        <h2 id="calculation">Calculation of Thermodynamics Quantities</h2>
        <p>From that point on, we have been able to study the thermodynamic properties of massive gravitational systems such as black holes and FLRW universe, much like we study ideal fluids.</p>
        
        <h3>Calculation of Volume</h3>
        <p>The volume of these fluid systems is related to their shape and size; for instance, the volume calculation differs for black holes of different shapes.</p>
        <div class="equation">
            \[
            V = \frac{4\pi}{3} \tilde{r}_{h}^{3}
            \]
        </div>
        <p>...</p>

        <h3>Calculation of Temperature</h3>
        <p>The temperature is generally expressed using the Hawking temperature:</p>
        <div class="equation">
            \[
            T = \frac{|\kappa|}{2\pi}
            \]
        </div>

        <h2 id="research-integrity">Research Integrity</h2>
        <p>From the above discussion, it’s clear that this type of paper can be easily mass-produced. Even our undergraduate thesis projects are more challenging and meaningful than this, yet we don’t consider our work worthy of publication.</p>
        <p>...</p>
