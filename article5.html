    At first, we submitted our paper to arxiv, but arxiv stated that they do not accept commentary papers, so we decided to submit to JHEP. However, JHEP turned out to be quite an odd journal.
</p>
<p>
    First, it is an open-access journal but does not require any payment. It is a journal under Scoap3, and its publication fees come from donated funds (which means they always profit as long as papers are published).
</p>
<p>
    Second, JHEP has a tied relationship with arxiv. If a paper has not been submitted to arxiv, it cannot be submitted to JHEP (submission to JHEP requires a arxiv ID).
</p>
<p>
    Third, after submitting to JHEP, the paper entered the review process. Interestingly, after more than two months of review, we received the following feedback:
</p>
<blockquote>
    "JHEP is the journal for publication of new results but not for commenting on other papers."
</blockquote>
<p>
    What’s even more peculiar is that the editors not only refuse to handle problematic papers but also do not accept or process them. They only care about new results, not the correctness of those results. Isn’t this just the same style as arxiv?
</p>
<p>
    At that point, we realized the root of the problem: we shouldn’t have sent such harsh emails to criticize the arxiv team (they ended up banning our account).

      <p>
        This paper reviews the "Insight into the Microstructure of FRW Universe from a P-V Phase Transition (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP09(2023)147" target="_blank">JHEP., 2023, 147</a>)."
        We found that the content is nearly identical to their previous work, amounting to a case of redundant publication. Furthermore, the paper lacks any form of innovation.
    </p>
      <h2>Comments</h2>
      <p>
        Recently, we published a paper titled <i>"Paper Mills and Research Integrity in Cosmology: Investigating P-V Phase Transitions in Massive Systems"</i> <sup>[1]</sup>. The current paper builds upon and extends the findings from that earlier work.
    </p>

    <p>
        As noted in <sup>[1]</sup>, the field of cosmological thermodynamics faces several critical issues, particularly regarding ethical concerns such as academic misconduct, including fraud, redundant publications, and plagiarism. The paper under review, titled <i>Insight into the Microstructure of FRW Universe from a P-V Phase Transition</i> <sup>[2]</sup>, reflects similar problems, specifically in the form of plagiarism and duplicated content.
    </p>

    <p>
        As highlighted in Reference <sup>[1]</sup>, many studies exploring the thermodynamic properties of gravitational systems lack originality. A common approach in this field involves selecting a system with a different metric and using its Friedmann equations to replicate previous findings. However, the paper in question takes this a step further by directly copying results from "The P-V Phase Transition of the FRW Universe" <sup>[3]</sup>, with a reported similarity rate as high as 70%.
    </p>

      <p>The Friedmann equations provided in Reference <sup>[3]</sup> are given as follows:</p>
  
      <div class="math-block">
          $$ (1+\alpha H^2) H^2 = \frac{8\pi}{3} \rho_m \quad \text{(1)} $$
      </div>
  
      <div class="math-block">
          $$ (1+2\alpha H^2) \dot{H} = -4\pi (\rho_m + p_m) \quad \text{(2)} $$
      </div>
  
      <p>In comparison, the Friedmann equations in <i>Insight into the Microstructure of FRW Universe from a P-V Phase Transition</i> are presented as:</p>
  
      <div class="math-block">
          $$ \rho = \rho_m + \rho_{\Lambda} = \frac{3H^2}{8\pi}(1+\alpha H^2) \quad \text{(3)} $$
      </div>
  
      <div class="math-block">
          $$ p = p_m + p_{\Lambda} = -\frac{3H^2}{8\pi}(1+\alpha H^2) - \frac{1+2\alpha H^2}{4\pi} \dot{H} \quad \text{(4)} $$
      </div>
      <p>
        It is clear that these equations are essentially identical. Consequently, the equations of state derived from them are also equivalent:
    </p>

    <div class="math-block">
        $$ P = \frac{T}{2R_A} + \frac{1}{8\pi R_A^2} + \frac{\alpha T}{R_A^3} - \frac{\alpha}{8\pi R_A^4} \quad \text{(1)} $$
    </div>

    <p>and</p>

    <div class="math-block">
        $$ P = \frac{T}{2} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3V} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}} + \frac{1}{8\pi} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3V} \right)^{\frac{2}{3}} + \frac{4\pi \alpha T}{3V} - \frac{\alpha}{8\pi} \left( \frac{4\pi}{3V} \right)^{\frac{4}{3}} \quad \text{(2)} $$
    </div>
    <p>
      Since $ H = \frac{1}{R_A} $, these equations are clearly identical. In fact, the paper <sup>[2]</sup> has directly lifted results from <sup>[3]</sup>, and this copied material constitutes a substantial portion of the work. Moreover, Section 3 of the paper under review exhibits a high degree of similarity to Reference <sup>[3]</sup>, amounting to clear instances of plagiarism and redundant publication.
  </p>

  <p>
      The concluding section of the paper further replicates the computational methods, analysis, and discussions from Reference <sup>[4]</sup>, offering no new insights, calculations, or methodological contributions.
